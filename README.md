# stressors_and_reefs
This repository is for R code analyzing how multiple stressors impact the spatial distribution of living coral in the central Philippines.

Within each folder is a driver.R file that explains the other code in the folder including purpose, inputs, and outputs. 

bin_processing = R code for processing spatial files

bin_fishing_measures = R code for estimating fishing effort (e.g. 10 year lag effort vs contemporary effort)

bin_analysis = R code for modeling processed data and making figures for manuscript
